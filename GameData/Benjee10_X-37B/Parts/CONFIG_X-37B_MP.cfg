	description = Initially designed for military applications, the Mk-X fuselage system was a rejected precursor to the now ubiquitous Mk-2 spaceplane system. As this tank is filled with EXTREMELY DANGEROUS, TOXIC, AND EXPLOSIVE rocket propellant, please take special care to keep out of direct sunlight for long stretches of time.
