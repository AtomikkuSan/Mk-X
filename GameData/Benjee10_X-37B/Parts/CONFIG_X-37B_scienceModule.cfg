	manufacturer = AtomicTech Inc.
	description = After a stringent series of tests, the Mk-X Spaceplane System was rated for kermanned flight and the Black Projects Division was eager to reach out to other contractors in the Aerospace Industry in order to expand the system's capabilities. Atomic Technologies Incorporated, after hearing about the opportunity, jumped at the chance to get the lucrative contract. Soon after the success of the Barium Command Module and the Hawk Wings, the engineers at AtomicTech Inc. combined their knowledge of compact scientific equipment and countless games of Kertwister! to design and build the AT-AVL "Wells" Aerodynamic Crewed Science Module. This module is a state of the art, compact scientific laboratory that will keep your Kerbals busy for long stretches of time.
