Mk-X SPACEPLANE PARTS PACK for KSP 1.2.0.
X-37b Inspired Spaceplane System.
==========
Version 1.0.0
==========
A Kerbal Space Program parts pack created by Benjee10.
==========

INTRODUCTION

This set of parts is designed to fit together to create a rough analogue of the United States Air Force's X-37B Spaceplane. The fuselage size is approximately 1.875m in diameter, making it ideal for transporting small (up to 1.25m) probes or other payloads up to orbit. 

At this point the parts have not been completely balanced for gameplay within career mode and there may still be some bugs with the aero. 

INSTALLATION

Drop the 'Benjee10_X-37B' folder inside your GameData directory.
